# Chapter2 Data Binding And Component Communication
In this chapter we will learn data binding and component communication. We start with all
logic in root component and then we start segregation of components and passing data
from one component to other component.

### Property and Event Binding
To communicate or pass the data between components we use property binding and event binding
To pass the data we create our own property and bind the data to it, as we did in Chapter 1
and then we create our own event and bind it to event.

#### Property binding
By default all variables of a component is visible to that component only. If we want to expose
any property or variable for property binding then we need to use @Input() decorator on that
particular property. Ex.
[server-view.component.ts](/src/app/server/server-view/server-view.component.ts)

In above component we expose the element property, by putting @Input() over it. Then to bind
it we used square bracket and pass the value. 
[chapter2-root.component.html](/src/app/chapter2-root.component.html)


#### Event Binding
Till now we have seen property binding to bind data to property or variable of class. This will
pass data to class, now we learn other direction i.e. passing data on event to parent component
or the component within it contained. To emit a event we need to do below steps:
  * Create variables with the name of event you want to expose.
  * Use @Output decorator to expose them as event.
  * Your variable in step 1 should be of type EventEmitter.
  * Assign new variable to variables.
  * Now to emit event we use EventEmitter emit method and pass the data we want to pass
  as part of event.
  
Ex. [server-form.component.ts](/src/app/server/server-form/server-form.component.ts)

#### Issue with Data and Event binding
When we are passing the data using data or event binding then this chain grows depends on the
distance of two component to each other. For Ex. if a component sit net to each other. Then we
need to pass the data to parent component from one component and then parent will pass data to
other component. So this will grow up, to resolve this we will use services in upcoming next 
chapters. But for simple use cases like this, Data binding and Event binding is better approach.
Now we will use these technique to our course project and practice them.

### View Encapsulation
Angular provides view encapsulation, which helps us to design better components. Due to this view
encapsulation the styling is applied to component on which it is define, it will not apply to child
or parent component of it. For global styling we use stylesheet which we import using angular.json
file. We can override in component by adding property in @Component decorator, with name encapsulation
and value from ViewEncapsulation class which is None which means that the style will apply globally
then Emulated is default one which we have, Native i.e. browser native styling. But we rarely want to 
override it.

### Local references in template
We can put the local references in our templates by using #variable_name on HTML tags. We can create
reference to any DOM element and access that within the template not outside the template. Ex.:
```angular2html
<input type="text" class="form-control" #serverNameInput>
```
If we want to use this particular variable in our typescript code then we need to pass the reference 
to method.
```angular2
onAddServer(serverNameInput: HTMLInputElement) {
    this.serverAdded.emit({
      name: serverNameInput.value,
      content: this.newServerContent
    });
  }
```
If we want to access this variable in typescript class then we need to use @ViewChild Decorator.
```angular2html
<input type="text" class="form-control" #serverContentInput>
```
```angular2
@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput: ElementRef;
```

### Projecting using ng-content
Sometimes we get into the situation where we need to project the HTML which is passed between
the opening and closing of our custom component tags Example of such scenario is when you are
working with tab or card component and expecting to content is passed by template using it.
For Ex. we can move server Blueprint view like this.
```angular2html
 <ch-server-view *ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements" [element]="serverElement">
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong *ngIf="serverElement.type === 'server'" style="color: red">{{ serverElement.content }}</strong>
          <em *ngIf="serverElement.type === 'blueprint'">{{ serverElement.content }}</em>
        </p>
</ch-server-view>
```
and then to project this we can use 'ng-content' directive within our template in which we are working.
```angular2html
 <div class="card-body">
    <ng-content></ng-content>
  </div>
```

## Component LifeCycle
We have seen ngOnInit method on every new component generated. This is a lifecycle hook. When Angular 
initiated component it goes through couple of stages for lifecycle and provide us hooks to execute custom
code for this. We are going to see component lifecycle and hooks provided by Angular to those stages to
execute custom code.
  * ngOnChanges - Called after a bound input property changes(Called also when component created) 
  * ngOnInit - Called once the component is initialized (Run after constructor)
  * ngDoCheck - Called during every change detection run
  * ngAfterContentInit - Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
  * ngAfterContentChecked - Called every time the projected content has been checked
  * ngAfterViewInit - Called after the componentâ€™s view (and child views) has been initialized
  * ngAfterViewChecked - Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
  * ngOnDestroy - Called once the component is about to be destroyed

Ex. : [server-view.component.ts](src/app/server/server-view/server-view.component.ts)

### Access ng-content local variable access
When we use ng-content which is going to project in template and we declare variable in it
and we want to access it within the component it is going to project, then to get access to
that variable we use @ContentChild decorator. Ex. 
[server-view.component.ts](src/app/server/server-view/server-view.component.ts)
