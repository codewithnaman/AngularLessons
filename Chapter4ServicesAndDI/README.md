# Chapter 4 Services and Dependency Injection
Services are one of most important part of our application. We can user services to have cross-cutting logic like 
logging, HTTP calls or as central repository for the data. 

For demonstrate benefits and advantage we get from services, In initial commit of this chapter we have application
which use the data binding and event binding to pass the data and stores into root component class. We will use
Services to remove long data binding and event binding chains and store the data in a centralize place from where 
different component can interAact.
