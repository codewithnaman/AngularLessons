# Forms
Angular Forms library provide a way to connect your logic(.ts file) with your form inputs. Also we
need to validate input and change visualization depending on the validation and other properties.
Angular form library provide these thing to us. There are two way of building a form in Angular
  * Template Driven Approach - In this approach Angular infers the Form Object from DOM, we will
    work on DOM and attach that to TS file.
  * Reactive Approach - Form is created programmatically and the Form, once they are in place
    we will connect them manually, which gives us fined grained control on our forms.
 
 
In this section of course, We will first see the both the approach and then in Syntax comparison section
we will cover a table which contains function with the syntax used in both the Approach:


We will start by designing same form in template. We are commiting same as first commit for this chapter.
